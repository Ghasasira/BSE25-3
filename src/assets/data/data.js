  problemStatement:" The rising prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) highlights a critical need for more engaging and accessible educational tools. Traditional methods of raising awareness and promoting prevention, such as pamphlets or lectures, often fail to effectively engage young audiences. An interactive, educational game can provide a more compelling and immersive way to inform individuals, particularly teens and young adults, about the risks, symptoms, and preventive measures related to STDs, encouraging safer behaviors and reducing the spread of infections.",
